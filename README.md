### Deep learning examples I tested (the Covid Xray DeTraC analysis CNN is developed by the lab of Mohamed Gaber)
#### I first tried the Python implementation in 2021 github.com/xfsala/DeTraC_COVId19, but it is now only available in Matlab 
#### A Python version is now available here: github.com/asmaa4may/DeTraC_COVId19/tree/master/python_code
