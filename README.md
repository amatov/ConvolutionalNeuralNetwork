### CNN analyses I have run (the Covid Xray DeTraC is developed by the lab of Mohamed Gaber)
#### I tested the Python DeTraC implementation in 2021 https://github.com/xfsala/DeTraC_COVId19, but currently is only available in Matlab 
#### A Python version is available at present here: https://github.com/asmaa4may/DeTraC_COVId19/tree/master/python_code
