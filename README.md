### Machine learning (regression analysis such as Lasso) and deep learning analyses I have run (the Covid Xray DeTraC is developed by the lab of Mohamed Gaber) and a 3D CNN architecture for real-time image segmentation and action recognition I configured in the fall of 2019 (R2Plus1D model, PyTorch) based on work by the group of Mubarak Shah

#### I tested the DeTraC (ResNet18) Python implementation in 2021 https://github.com/xfsala/DeTraC_COVId19, but currently is only available in Matlab 
#### A Python version is available at present here: https://github.com/asmaa4may/DeTraC_COVId19/tree/master/python_code
